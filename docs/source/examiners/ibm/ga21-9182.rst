IBM GA21-9182 Floppy labels
===========================

These labels are named after the IBM document-number where they are documented,
several versions of the document are available on Bitsavers under /pdf/ibm/floppy.

I dont know how regious IBM was about using these labels on floppy disks,
but so far I have seen them on floppies from IBM/3X and DisplayWriter.

This examiner gathers single or multi-floppy filesets, and creates artifacts
for the files thereon.

Beware that only very basic file/record relationships are implemented yet.

Bad-sector handling is not implemented either.
